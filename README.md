# Pokedex App

This application will serve the pokemon masters, to review the pokemos, meet them and know their name.

## First steps

1. Download this repository
2. Open the project from Android Studio
3. Wait for Android Studio to load the project
4. Set up an emulator or use a mobile phone with Android to run the application.

## Whats Next?

1. As a pokemon master, you are assigned credentials that will serve you to log in to the app, email jxlopez@domain.com and password 123456
2. Upon entering you can see the world of pokemos, where you will be shown the images of the pokemons and their name,
with this you will become familiar with this wonder (I hope you do not spend much time in it, remember that there are obligations at home ).
3. If you know any pokemon and want to search directly, you can press the "Search" icon located in the upper right, there you can write the name of the pokemon.
4. If you want to exit the pokedex, press the "LogOut" icon.

## Extra

For those who like the most extreme things, pokedex has unit and UI tests, the unit tests the API service as well as
if the Entity used stores the data well, the UI tests several user flows, such as the start of session, which can be if
you write an erroneous email, or until the fields are left empty, just do an automatic search and test the action "LogOut".

## How can you use it?

1. In Android Studio, click on the "configurations dialog" section, there is mostly the name of the "app", if you click
the UI and Unit test options will appear, if it does not appear, DON'T WORRY , see point 2.
2. If you are here, it is because you did not see the options indicated above, let's do the following: In the section
where the project is, the classes, etc. There is an "androidTest" and "test" package, there you will see the classes and you can right click on those classes and then on the "Run" option, so the test will be executed and now you can apply what is described in point 1.
